<p>Then, [the practitioner] visualizes [Vajrasattva] as being present in the form of (<foreign>bhūtvā</foreign>) lunar discs emanated from the hearts of All Tathāgatas; as making all sentient beings throughout all world-systems penetrate selflessness; as creating singleminded focus upon the shape of a lunar disc; <note><seg rend="check">RT: The term cittaikāgratā is a definition of samādhi in Abhidharma literature. The present passage alludes to the opening of STTS (§20) where Sarvārthasiddhi sees a lunar dics which represents bodhicitta. </seg></note> [and] as arriving in the positions of all deities, precisely in the form of lunar discs.</p>

<p>Then [according to his visualization] knowledge-rays emanate from them,<note>The moon discs.</note> enter the vajra in his own heart,<note>That is Vairocana's, i.e. the practioner's, own heart. See the first sentence of §2.2.1.2.</note> and become one with it. [Whereupon] he should visualize [it] as having taken, thanks to the empowerment of All Tathāgatas, the form of a great five-pronged vajra as extensive as the assembly of the universe; as having once again become, like previously, of the size of the vajra in his heart; and as emanating from it onto his hand. And from that [vajra] are emanating rays, which this time have the shape of vajras, multiple colors and multiple forms, and they expand throughout the System of the Universe. From them [emanates], this time taking the form of Vajrasattva, etc., the whole System of Beings, and he applies it to the Complete Awakening with the Knowledge of the Equality of All Tathāgatas without exception (<foreign>yāvat</foreign>), and the rest.<note>The rest alluded to here with <foreign>ādi</foreign> seems to be the list <foreign>sarvatathāgatamahābodhicittotpādana...sarvatathāgatarddhivikurvitāni</foreign> in STTS §39.</note> Through Contraction Yoga, they once again take the body of a single being and enter the vajra in his own heart. He should visualize a hymn being sung by him (i.e., Vajrasattva) who is present there:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
Oh, I am Samantabhadra, the solid being of the Self-born [Buddhas]. Though bodiless, thanks to their having a solid body, I have obtained the body of a being!<note>It seems that Ānandagarbha interpreted this udāna quite differently. See <title>Tattvālokakarī</title> on  STTS 40: ```Oh' means amazement. `I' am [Vajrasattva, or the practitioner?] himself. [I am] self-born because [I am] born on my own, and [therefore] the Lord Buddha. `The solid being' is the unbreakable being. If you are Samantabhadra among Buddhas, what is the amazement? [Answering this question, the part] beginning with [the words] `because of solidness' is recited. The relative pronoun <foreign>yad</foreign> means the reasoning (<foreign>rgyu gang gis</foreign>, *<foreign>yena hetunā</foreign>). Although bodiless because of solidness, i.e. although I have non-dual mind as my nature, I am in the body of a being, which means that I have the body of a being itself as my nature, which in turn means that I am in the state of the body of a being (<foreign>sattvakāyatvam</foreign>). <foreign>āgataḥ</foreign> means `having obtained'. It is the amazement that [I am] accomplished in this way. This is taught as follows: Although I have non-dual knowledge as my nature and therefore am formless, I will show the form-body (<foreign>gzugs kyi sku</foreign>, *<foreign>rūpakāya</foreign>) of my own to the people to be instructed."</note>
</p>

<p>Then he should visualize [Vajrasattva] as having descended from his heart and standing in front of Akṣobhya while requesting instruction.<note><seg rend="check">RT: The expression <foreign>ājñāṁ mārgayamānam</foreign> seems to be a circumlocution for asking a <foreign>samaya</foreign>.</seg></note></p>

<p>Then he should perform the consecration to Emperorship of the Family of All Tathāgatas with the consecration by means of a crown-turban representing the Five-Buddhas. Together with a bell marked with the primordial Vajra, he should give to Samantabhadra the primordial Vajra that consists in unsurpassed conduct, etc., [and] generates the Complete Awakening with the Knowledge of the Equality of All Tathāgatas without exception, in order to create the Complete Whole System of Beings. Then he should give the name-consecration, etc.<note>It seems that the term abhisamaya (as seen in STTS §42 <foreign>yāvat-sarvatathāgata-samatājñānābhijñānuttara-mahāyānābhisamayottamasiddhy-avāpti-phala-hetos</foreign>) and abhisambodhi (as used here by Ānandagarbha) are interchangeable in the STTS system. Cf. STTS §196 <foreign>sarvatathāgata-samatājñānābhijñābhisambodhy-uttamasiddhaye</foreign>.</note>
Subsequently he should sing a hymn with self-identification as Vajrapāṇi:</p>

<!--%"This" is so called [because the practitioner] placed [the vajra] in his heart. (Or: Having placed [the vajra] in his heart, [the practitioner] called [the vajra] "this".)
%"All tathāgatas is Vairocana etc. "Siddhivajra" is [so called because it is] for the sake of accomplishment and/or because it has accomplishment as its nature.
%[This is] unsurpassed because it is taught: \begin{quote}

%"It (tat)" is that which is bestowed by  Vairocana.
%% A explains that tat in the udāna is correlative with the relative pronoun (yad) not mentioned in the udāna.
%With regard to "I", the vajra [bestowed] is I.
%With regard to [the phrase] "given into my hand", the form of vajra which has the nature of I is given into my hand.
%Because so, I have been "established as a Vajra in the Vajra."

%With regard to the second udāna, I have checked the commentary on the STTS by Ānandagarbha. The pratīka of the relevant part is sarvabuddhānām, implying that <foreign>tat</foreign> is not a part of a compound.

%Probably "given into (Akṣobhya's) hand" should be "given in my (Vajrasattva's) hand." The 3rd and 4th pādas have the same structure: aha = vajram, mama kare = vajre, and dattam = pratiṣṭhitam.

<p>In the same way he should visualize [another] hymn being sung by [the group of Bodhisattvas starting with Vajrarāja and]<note>The parallel passage in KSP has <foreign>vajrasattvād ārabhya yāvad vajramuṣṭiparyantaṁ</foreign>, but in our context the group begins with Vajrarāja.</note> ending with Vajramuṣṭi who are present in the middle of the Vajra in the heart of Vairocana thanks to his emanation, expansion, contraction and stabilization in his abode,<note>These actions are all alluded to in the previous section.</note> as well as a hymn right after the consecration.<note>Vilāsavajra on MNS <seg rend="check">4.135</seg> <foreign>khaḍgapāṇiṁ vicintya taddhṛccandropary akāraṁ dhyātvā pūrvavat spharaṇasaṁharaṇanilayadṛḍhībhāvādikaṁ kṛtvā bhāvayed iti sarvatra yojanīyam</foreign>.

<!--%ad STTS 46 udāna
%[With regard to the stanza] beginning with "Oh", the word "Oh" is as before.
%With regard to "a hook born from the Vajra", for the reason that it is born from the body of All Tathāgata (singular), it is born from the Vajra.
%It is called a hook in the meaning that the body is caught and drawn down by means of it. The word hook is used inasmuch as it resemble a hook as a way to drawn down All Tathāgata.
%The words "I am Amogharāja" are used [to denote that] I am the king to bring the fruit unfailingly.
%In this case, what is the amazement? [Answering this, the part] beginning with "because Buddha is omnipresent" is recited.
%The relative pronoun "yad" means the reasoning (gtan tshigs gang gis, *yena hetunā / yena kāraṇena).
%It is the amazement to summon Buddha the Blessed One abiding in all the ether permanent ly, i.e. to draw [him] down from the omnipresent, by means of Vajra-like body, speech and mind, i.e. selfless knowledge, for the sake of the accomplishment.
%[To sum up,] it is taught as follows. Since the Buddhas and I are not separated from each other, i.e. I am equal to the omnipresent, I draw down All Tathāgata,
%those to be instructed see me as that [= a hook]. Therefore, I am not different from the nature of the [hook].-->

Oh, the good deed<note>The reading <foreign>satkriyā</foreign>of the <foreign>codex unicus</foreign> of STTS is confirmed not only by the testimony for this <foreign>udāna</foreign> here and in KSP chapter 6 but also by the Tibetan transmission of the commentaries by Ānandagarba and Śākyamitra, who both offer glosses that our translation follows.

<p>Then he should make fourfold obeisance<note>See STTS §214.</note> and, positioned with the great seal of Śrī Vajrasattva,<note>See STTS §255.</note> he should visualize his own self as the vajra of the bodies, speech and thoughts of All Tathāgatas [while reciting] with this [mantra]: <hi rend="mantra">om̐, I am one in nature with the vajra!</hi> Then [he should visualize his own self] as pure by nature [with this mantra]: <hi rend="mantra">om̐, I am pure by nature!</hi>, and [lastly] as having the nature of all deities starting with Vairocana inasmuch as he is equal to them in selflessness, [with this mantra]: <hi rend="mantra">om̐, I am the same as all of them!</hi></p>

<p>Then, while pronouncing the hundred-syllable [mantra] of Śrī Vajrasattva with the vajra-voice, or mentally, he should cultivate [the idea]: `I am am none other than all!'. And he should hold the conviction: `From the mouths of all deities rings forth the sound of mantras!'. In this way [the mantras] are recited by all [deities]. He should keep cultivating it as long as no fatigue arises. When he is fatigued, he should again give the praise with the One hundred and eight names [and] guest water; should perform the worship and fourfold obeisance; and, wherever seals are formed, he should release them there. The releasing of the seals of Sattvavajra, etc., is [with the mantra: <hi rend="mantra">vajra muḥ</hi>. The regulation for the place [of applying the four seals] for Śrī Vajrasattva, etc., has been discussed.<note><seg rend="check">In Svādhiṣṭhāna part Ādiyoga: see KSP 6-2-4. See also 2.2.1.1.</seg></note> For [the four Jinas] Akṣobhya, etc., the place is the same as the [respective] place of Vajrasattva, Vajraratna, Vajradharma and Vajrakarma. The crown is the place for Vairocana.</p>

<p>Then he should perform the complete seal consecration using the pledge-seal of Vajraratna arisen from his heart and placed at [Vajraratna'] own consecration position, [using the mantra]: <hi rend="mantra">om̐ consecrate, o vajraratna!</hi> After that he should perform the binding of the cuirass as before, with the index fingers,<note><seg rend="check">In the Ādiyoga section; see KSP 6-2-1-5.</seg></note> [using the mantra]: <hi rend="mantra">solidify my complete seal with the best cuirass vam̐!</hi> At the end he should gratify [all deities] with the [seal] that <seg rend="check">has flat palms</seg> and, after pronouncing the hundred-syllable (mantra) of Vajrasattva should transfer the merit to  accomplishing the desired aim. He should implore all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas [saying]: `If I have commited any omission in the ceremony, you may please forgive me!'. And after giving them guest water he should encourage them to depart.</p>

<p rend="stanza">
Om̐! You have worked for the benefit of all beings! Having given success as sought, please go to the land of the Buddhas, to come back later.

<p>Above, he should release [the seal of] Sattvavajrī with this heart: <hi rend="mantra">o Vajrasattva, muḥ!</hi> In this way, all are dismissed.</p>

<p>And he should mentally cause the gathering of circles with retinues (i.e., the Vajradhātumaṇḍala), as it has been generated, to enter with Perfect Union<note>Probably a techn. term.

Or else he should, as previously, practice Great Union<note>Bu ston teaches in his <hi rend="italic">Yid bzhin kyi nor bu</hi>, a commentary on the SVU, teaches that the <hi rend="italic">mahāyoga</hi> is from the internal bathing (<hi rend="italic">adhyātmasnāna</hi>) up to the practice of the four kinds of <hi rend="italic">mudrā</hi>, i.e. <hi rend="italic">mahāmudrā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">samayamudrā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dharmamudrā</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">karmamudrā</hi>, and that the first union (<hi rend="italic">ādiyoga</hi>), of which the core part is the <hi rend="italic">pañcākārābhisaṁbodhi</hi>, starts after  the practice of the four kinds of mudrā (<hi rend="italic">Ijuin</hi> 2016). There is no such clear distinction in the SVU itself.
	If we compare the structure of the SVU with that of the <hi rend="italic">*Trailokyavijayodayā</hi>, a manual by the same author of the practices based upon the system of the Trailokayavijayamahāmaṇḍala of the STTS, the latter teaches the “single yoga (<hi rend="italic">rnal 'gyor gcig</hi>, <hi rend="italic">*ekayoga</hi>)” which is alternative to the <hi rend="italic">mahāyoga</hi> after the self empowerment (<hi rend="italic">svādhiṣṭhāna</hi>). While the practitioner should accomplish the <hi rend="italic">mahāmudrā</hi> of Vajrahūṁkāra and practice the four kinds of <hi rend="italic">mudrā</hi> of the five Buddhas in the single yoga, he should accomplish the <hi rend="italic">mahāmudrā</hi> of the thirty-two deities of the Trailokayavijayamahāmaṇḍala and practice the four kinds of <hi rend="italic">mudrā</hi> of  those deities in  <hi rend="italic">mahāyoga</hi>. This <hi rend="italic">mahāyoga</hi> in the *Trailokyavijayodayā corresponds to the sections in the SVU which teach <seg rend="check">the accomplishment of the <hi rend="italic">mahāmudrā</hi> the twenty-eight bodhisattvas</seg> and the practice of the four kinds of <hi rend="italic">mudrā</hi> of those deities (sections 39–59 in Takahashi's Japanese translation).

</p>
<p>All mantras, whether relevant for worldly or soteriological aims, can be made effective through the Great Union. As for one who is unable to visualize the maṇḍala, he should perform the Great Union and then recite a hundred-thousand times each individual mantra.</p>

<p>Having thus carried out the preliminary service, he should draw the maṇḍala in the northeastern part of a monastery, a park, a village or a city, or where it is agreeable to his mind, on a piece of ground that is even, smooth, gently sloping, of proper dimensions and not saline. For a king (it should measure) a hundred or fifty cubits; for feudatory chiefs (<foreign>sāmanta</foreign>) or feudatory princes (<foreign>mahāsāmanta</foreign>), fifty or twenty-five cubits; for a guild foreman or a merchant, twenty-five or half of it; for (ordinary) practitioners,%<note>Can we come up with a nicer translation, to bring across that the word <foreign>sādhaka</foreign> refers to one who seeks only <foreign>siddhi</foreign>, not release?</note>

<p>Then he should purify the ground.

<p>Then with recourse to (the mantras of the) sixteen Bodhisattvas<note>Add note on them.</note> he once again smears the maṇḍala ground with fragrant paste, decorates it all around the outside with flowers, gives <foreign>argha</foreign> to all the families (of the five Tathāgatas) present in the sky, worships them with recourse to Puṣpā, etc., and to Lāsyā, etc., pays obeisance, visualizes the yellow-colored sun and  moon in his left and right eyes as transformations of two syllables <hi rend="mantra">jaḥ</hi>, and fashion the maṇḍala to the accompaniment of song and sound (i.e., music) offerings.</p>

<p>In that connection, first he makes the thread wet with white fragrant paste over whose colorant the mantra (i.e., <hi rend="mantra">āḥ</hi>) has previously been pronounced.<note>This refers to the beginning if the chapter.</note> Then he pronounces <hi rend="mantra">o vajradhātu</hi><note>The form <foreign>vajradhātu</foreign> is an Ārṣa vocative; see STTS §<seg rend="check">XX</seg>.</note> only in his mind, with the vajra-voice,<note>ADD note on this.</note> and after becoming Vairocana he turns the assistant into a form of Vajrakarma while pronouncing (the mantra) <hi rend="mantra">o vajrakarma</hi> (emitted) from his own heart.<note>See STTS §114.</note> Then he visualizes himself as Vajrasattva while pronouncing the (mantra of) Vajrasattva, takes that thread with his left hand in Vajramuṣṭi (<foreign>mudrā</foreign>) and with the syllable <hi rend="mantra">jaḥ</hi> sends forth that assistant in the form of Vajrakarma who holds (the other end of) the thread in his hand, after which, in order to convey (the maṇḍala) to symmetry, he should face East and lay down the (first) brahmā-thread.<note>ADD note on this.</note> Next, standing in the South and facing North, the master (should lay down) the second. Then, standing in the Southeast, facing North, (he should lay down) the Eastern thread of the outside of the maṇḍala. Standing in the Northwest, facing South, (he should lay down) the western thread. Standing in the same place, (he should lay down) the northern thread. Standing in the Southeast again, (he should lay down) the southern side thread. And so also delineation of the platform. Standing in the southeastern corner again (he should lay down a thread) up to the northwestern corner. Standing in the Southwest, he should lay down (a thread) uo to the northeastern corner. And the movement of the master and the assistant is in pradakṣiṇa procedure. In that connection, there is this delineation mantras: <hi rend="mantra">om̐ do not transgress the thread which is the vajra pledge hūm̐</hi>. With three <hi rend="mantra">jaḥ</hi> syllables, i.e., with <hi rend="mantra">jaḥ jaḥ jaḥ</hi>, the assistant should perform the thread drawing.<note>See Tanemura 2004: 146.</note></p>

<p>And the gates are an eighth part (of the length of a side). The projections of the gates have the measure of the gates. The completely internal and the completely external platforms measure half of the gates. The ground for five-colored powder measures half of the platform. The gateway should be made three times (the measure of) the gate.</p>

<p>He should delineate the inner maṇḍala (measured) by half of the outer maṇḍala, is square, has four gates, is enclosed by a platform and has eight pillars. After this he should consecrate as before with the stake-mantra a stake of Khadira (wood) which at the bottom has the shape of a single-pronged vajra, and at the top the shape of a five-pronged vajra, and drives it into the navel of the maṇḍala with a vajra. After this, with the thread hanging from it, he should delineate the garland of vajras outside of the inner maṇḍala starting in the Northeast and proceeding in pradakṣiṇa. And the thread is double the length of the maṇḍala; in thickness (<foreign>pārimaṇḍalya</foreign>) it is to be made as thick<note><seg rend="check">Or as long?</seg></note> as the (master's) little finger, in the case of a six-cubit (maṇḍala) and suitably (thicker) in other cases.<note><seg rend="check">See parallel passage in Rajaḥpātanavidhi.</seg></note>

<p>Now the delineation if expressed in the words of scripture:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
The wise one should delineate a nice maṇḍala with a new thread, that is as well applied, as well measured and as beautiful as possible:\\
He should delineate the external maṇḍala that is square, four-gated, adorned with four gateways, prepared with four threads<note>Brahmasūtra, pārśvasūtra, ...?</note>, adorned with fillets and wreaths, and inlaid at all its corners and angles of door projections with vajra-jewels.\\
Having entered its inner city that resembles a wheel, circumscribed with a thread of vajra, and adorned with eight pillars, the wise one should delineate (the interior) maṇḍala, conveying it to symmetry, with eight maṇḍalas (within it, separated) by four threads (running in pairs from East to West and North to South).<note>Cf. the Trailokyavijayamaṇḍala shown in Mori 1997: 93, fig. 29.</note></p>

<p>And on both outer and inner platforms are to be drawn full and half pearl-garlands, fly-whisks as well as lunar and solar orbs. In all corners of the maṇḍala are (to be placed) banners with colorful tips from which dangle bells that are fluttering in the wind.<note>Cf.

<p>Then he should let (the pupil) take a flower garland with his two middle fingers, and let him enter with this heart: <hi rend="mantra">o pledge hūm̐</hi>.

<p>Then the Vajra-master should display the Sattvavajrī-seal, both downward and upward, place it on the head of the Vajra-disciple, and say the following: `This pledge vajra will shatter your head, if you divulge it to anyone!'</p>

<p>Then he should, in the same manner with the Pledge-seal, once pronounce the imprecation-heart over the (pledge) water and give it to that disciple to drink. In that regard, there is is imprecation-heart:</p>

After that, he should visualize the syllable <hi rend="mantra">a</hi> in his own heart with a garland of Vajra-rays. Again, after letting the disciple visualize immaculate super pure Vajrasattva  <seg rend="check">as transformation from</seg> the syllable <hi rend="mantra">hūm̐</hi>, he should apply signs on his heart, brow, throat and forehead, with vajra, jewel, lotus and viśvavajra, as transformations of the syllables  <hi rend="mantra">hūm̐ hrīm̐ hrīḥ kam̐</hi>, and should  open his and his disciple's heart with the door-opening seal. Then he should emit the vajra situated in his own heart as transformation of the syllable <hi rend="mantra">a</hi>, mentally cause it to enter into the vajra situated in his disciple's heart, and visualize it as filling his entire body. He should say the following: `You should pronounce: ``And let all Tathāgatas take control, let Vajrasattva take posession of me!''.'
</p>
<p>Then the Vajra master quickly displays the Sattvavajrī, places it on the (disciple's) heart and should pronounce this:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
This pledge is that Vajra known as Vajrasattva. May the Vajra knowledge take possession of you right now.
<hi rend="mantra">vajra possession aḥ</hi>

<p>After it has been pronounced as many as ten times, or a hundred times, he certainly takes posssession (of the disciple).

And he should pronounce <hi rend="mantra">vajrasattva aḥ aḥ aḥ aḥ</hi>, and visualize (the disciple) as being filled with by Lord Vajrasattva emitting red light. If possession does not occur even in that way, then he should display the Vajrāveśasamaya seal together with the bell. He should step with his left foot on (the disciple's) right foot, while, in the sky above, above Śrī Vajrasattva, he visualizes Vairocana being stepped upon by the mass of rays of the wrathful syllable <hi rend="mantra">hūm̐</hi>,

and (while visualizing) below (the disciple) being raised up by the Vajravātamaṇḍalī (seal) to the accompaniment of the syllable <hi rend="mantra">hūm̐</hi>, and while visualizing (Śrī Vajrasattva) as being hurled down by Akṣobhya, etc., who reside in the East, etc., with the mass of rays of their own seeds — namely <hi rend="mantra">hūm̐ traḥ hrīḥ aḥ</hi> —, he should cause him to take possession (of the disciple). He should repeat <hi rend="mantra">vajrasattva aḥ aḥ aḥ aḥ</hi> in this same manner.</p>

<p>Now (if) due to superabundance of sin possession does not occur, his sins need to be exploded again and again with the sin-explosion-seal.</p>

<p rend="stanza">

</p>

<p>(This is the mantra he should use) after he has made an effigy of the sin with black sesame seeds in the palm of his right hand, has visualized the syllable <hi rend="mantra">hūm̐</hi> in the middle, in order to make the oblation with this index and thumb.
</p>
<p>Then (if) he leaves the oblation pit and visualizes in the (disciple's) body the sin being burnt by vajras full of flame garlands, (the deity) definitely takes possession. For one whose possession does not occur even in that way,  he should not carry out <seg rend="check">consecration</seg>.</p>

<p>And for one who is possessed, the ripening of the Five Magical powers, etc., then immediately occurs.</p>

If the (disciple), being possessed, displays the seal of Śrī Vajrasattva, then the master shows the seal of the Vajra-fist. In this way, all starting with Śrī Vajrasattva arrange their presence.

<p>Then comes the esoteric consecration.

<p>Then he should worship that altar with flowers, etc. Either on a lion-throne covered with a cloth (on which is depicted) a lunar disc, or on a (regular) seat that has been empowered with the Vajrayakṣa (mantra), he should as previously and transform him into Vajrasattva and install him there with the Great Seal of Vajrasattva.<note><seg rend="check">

<p>Then he takes the bell and, while sounding it (he should pronounce):</p>

<p>He should again take the mirror and say the following:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
For you, Vajrasattva is like a mirror: transparent, clear and stainless. The overlord of all Buddhas is himself present in the heart, o child.
</p>

<p>He should also say: `Understand that this overlord of all Tathāgatas is this aspiration to awakening'.<note>It seems that Ānandagarbha has forgotten the concluding <foreign>iti</foreign> that is required after <foreign>avagaccha</foreign>.</note> Now the mantra for his receiving of the mirror: <hi rend="mantra">ā vajrasattva</hi>.</p>

<p>Then he should place a wheel of the Law between (the disciple's) feet, give a conch (to be held) in his right hand, and say the following:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
From <seg rend="check">today/now</seg> onward, having filled the unsurpassed conch of the Law, turn the wheel of the Law in all direction immediately at the mere conception of the aspiration.\\
With unhesitating mind, you have no doubt or uncertainty. Give permanent light in the world to the precept which is the system of mantra practice.\\
You are praised as being a grateful servant of the Buddhas. And those Vajra-bearers all protect all around you.
