<p>Then, [the practitioner] visualizes [Vajrasattva] as being present in the form of (<foreign>bhūtvā</foreign>) lunar discs emanated from the hearts of All Tathāgatas; as making all sentient beings throughout all world-systems penetrate selflessness; as creating singleminded focus upon the shape of a lunar disc; <note><seg rend="check">RT: The term cittaikāgratā is a definition of samādhi in Abhidharma literature. The present passage alludes to the opening of STTS (§20) where Sarvārthasiddhi sees a lunar dics which represents bodhicitta. </seg></note> [and] as arriving in the positions of all deities, precisely in the form of lunar discs.</p>

<p>Then [according to his visualization] knowledge-rays emanate from them,<note>The moon discs.</note> enter the vajra in his own heart,<note>That is Vairocana's, i.e. the practioner's, own heart. See the first sentence of §2.2.1.2.</note> and become one with it. [Whereupon] he should visualize [it] as having taken, thanks to the empowerment of All Tathāgatas, the form of a great five-pronged vajra as extensive as the assembly of the universe; as having once again become, like previously, of the size of the vajra in his heart; and as emanating from it onto his hand. And from that [vajra] are emanating rays, which this time have the shape of vajras, multiple colors and multiple forms, and they expand throughout the System of the Universe. From them [emanates], this time taking the form of Vajrasattva, etc., the whole System of Beings, and he applies it to the Complete Awakening with the Knowledge of the Equality of All Tathāgatas without exception (<foreign>yāvat</foreign>), and the rest.<note>The rest alluded to here with <foreign>ādi</foreign> seems to be the list <foreign>sarvatathāgatamahābodhicittotpādana...sarvatathāgatarddhivikurvitāni</foreign> in STTS §39.</note> Through Contraction Yoga, they once again take the body of a single being and enter the vajra in his own heart. He should visualize a hymn being sung by him (i.e., Vajrasattva) who is present there:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
Oh, I am Samantabhadra, the solid being of the Self-born [Buddhas]. Though bodiless, thanks to their having a solid body, I have obtained the body of a being!<note>It seems that Ānandagarbha interpreted this udāna quite differently. See \ttl{Tattvālokakarī} on  STTS 40: ```Oh' means amazement. `I' am [Vajrasattva, or the practitioner?] himself. [I am] self-born because [I am] born on my own, and [therefore] the Lord Buddha. `The solid being' is the unbreakable being. If you are Samantabhadra among Buddhas, what is the amazement? [Answering this question, the part] beginning with [the words] `because of solidness' is recited. The relative pronoun <foreign>yad</foreign> means the reasoning (<foreign>rgyu gang gis</foreign>, *<foreign>yena hetunā</foreign>). Although bodiless because of solidness, i.e. although I have non-dual mind as my nature, I am in the body of a being, which means that I have the body of a being itself as my nature, which in turn means that I am in the state of the body of a being (<foreign>sattvakāyatvam</foreign>). <foreign>āgataḥ</foreign> means `having obtained'. It is the amazement that [I am] accomplished in this way. This is taught as follows: Although I have non-dual knowledge as my nature and therefore am formless, I will show the form-body (<foreign>gzugs kyi sku</foreign>, *<foreign>rūpakāya</foreign>) of my own to the people to be instructed."</note>
</p>

<p>Then he should visualize [Vajrasattva] as having descended from his heart and standing in front of Akṣobhya while requesting instruction.<note><seg rend="check">RT: The expression <foreign>ājñāṁ mārgayamānam</foreign> seems to be a circumlocution for asking a <foreign>samaya</foreign>.</seg></note></p>

<p>Then he should perform the consecration to Emperorship of the Family of All Tathāgatas with the consecration by means of a crown-turban representing the Five-Buddhas.

Then he should give the name-consecration, etc.<note>It seems that the term abhisamaya (as seen in STTS §42 <foreign>yāvat-sarvatathāgata-samatājñānābhijñānuttara-mahāyānābhisamayottamasiddhy-avāpti-phala-hetos</foreign>) and abhisambodhi (as used here by Ānandagarbha) are interchangeable in the STTS system.

Subsequently he should sing a hymn with self-identification as Vajrapāṇi:</p>

%"All tathāgatas is Vairocana etc. "Siddhivajra" is [so called because it is] for the sake of accomplishment and/or because it has accomplishment as its nature.

<!--%ad STTS 46 udāna
%[With regard to the stanza] beginning with "Oh", the word "Oh" is as before.
%With regard to "a hook born from the Vajra", for the reason that it is born from the body of All Tathāgata (singular), it is born from the Vajra.
%It is called a hook in the meaning that the body is caught and drawn down by means of it. The word hook is used inasmuch as it resemble a hook as a way to drawn down All Tathāgata.
%The words "I am Amogharāja" are used [to denote that] I am the king to bring the fruit unfailingly.
%In this case, what is the amazement? [Answering this, the part] beginning with "because Buddha is omnipresent" is recited.
%The relative pronoun "yad" means the reasoning (gtan tshigs gang gis, *yena hetunā / yena kāraṇena).
%It is the amazement to summon Buddha the Blessed One abiding in all the ether permanent ly, i.e. to draw [him] down from the omnipresent, by means of Vajra-like body, speech and mind, i.e. selfless knowledge, for the sake of the accomplishment.
%[To sum up,] it is taught as follows. Since the Buddhas and I are not separated from each other, i.e. I am equal to the omnipresent, I draw down All Tathāgata,
%those to be instructed see me as that [= a hook]. Therefore, I am not different from the nature of the [hook].-->

	If we compare the structure of the SVU with that of the <hi rend="italic">*Trailokyavijayodayā</hi>, a manual by the same author of the practices based upon the system of the Trailokayavijayamahāmaṇḍala of the STTS, the latter teaches the “single yoga (<hi rend="italic">rnal 'gyor gcig</hi>, <hi rend="italic">*ekayoga</hi>)” which is alternative to the <hi rend="italic">mahāyoga</hi> after the self empowerment (<hi rend="italic">svādhiṣṭhāna</hi>).

<p>He takes hold of it with the Vajrabandha (<foreign>mudrā</foreign>) and consecrates it a hundred and eight times with \mantra{om̐ do not transgress the thread which is the vajra pledge hūm̐}.</p>

<p>Then with recourse to (the mantras of the) sixteen Bodhisattvas<note>Add note on them.</note> he once again smears the maṇḍala ground with fragrant paste, decorates it all around the outside with flowers, gives <foreign>argha</foreign> to all the families (of the five Tathāgatas) present in the sky, worships them with recourse to Puṣpā, etc., and to Lāsyā, etc., pays obeisance, visualizes the yellow-colored sun and  moon in his left and right eyes as transformations of two syllables \mantra{jaḥ}, and fashion the maṇḍala to the accompaniment of song and sound (i.e., music) offerings.</p>

<p>In that connection, first he makes the thread wet with white fragrant paste over whose colorant the mantra (i.e., \mantra{āḥ}) has previously been pronounced.<note>This refers to the beginning if the chapter.</note> Then he pronounces \mantra{o vajradhātu}<note>The form <foreign>vajradhātu</foreign> is an Ārṣa vocative; see STTS §<seg rend="check">XX</seg>.</note> only in his mind, with the vajra-voice,<note>ADD note on this.</note> and after becoming Vairocana he turns the assistant into a form of Vajrakarma while pronouncing (the mantra) \mantra{o vajrakarma} (emitted) from his own heart.<note>See STTS §114.</note> Then he visualizes himself as Vajrasattva while pronouncing the (mantra of) Vajrasattva, takes that thread with his left hand in Vajramuṣṭi (<foreign>mudrā</foreign>) and with the syllable \mantra{jaḥ} sends forth that assistant in the form of Vajrakarma who holds (the other end of) the thread in his hand, after which, in order to convey (the maṇḍala) to symmetry, he should face East and lay down the (first) brahmā-thread.<note>ADD note on this.</note> Next, standing in the South and facing North, the master (should lay down) the second. Then, standing in the Southeast, facing North, (he should lay down) the Eastern thread of the outside of the maṇḍala. Standing in the Northwest, facing South, (he should lay down) the western thread. Standing in the same place, (he should lay down) the northern thread. Standing in the Southeast again, (he should lay down) the southern side thread. And so also delineation of the platform. Standing in the southeastern corner again (he should lay down a thread) up to the northwestern corner. Standing in the Southwest, he should lay down (a thread) uo to the northeastern corner. And the movement of the master and the assistant is in pradakṣiṇa procedure. In that connection, there is this delineation mantras: \mantra{om̐ do not transgress the thread which is the vajra pledge hūm̐}. With three \mantra{jaḥ} syllables, i.e., with \mantra{jaḥ jaḥ jaḥ}, the assistant should perform the thread drawing.<note>See Tanemura 2004: 146.</note></p>

<p>And the gates are an eighth part (of the length of a side). The projections of the gates have the measure of the gates. The completely internal and the completely external platforms measure half of the gates. The ground for five-colored powder measures half of the platform. The gateway should be made three times (the measure of) the gate.</p>

<p>He should delineate the inner maṇḍala (measured) by half of the outer maṇḍala, is square, has four gates, is enclosed by a platform and has eight pillars. After this he should consecrate as before with the stake-mantra a stake of Khadira (wood) which at the bottom has the shape of a single-pronged vajra, and at the top the shape of a five-pronged vajra, and drives it into the navel of the maṇḍala with a vajra. After this, with the thread hanging from it, he should delineate the garland of vajras outside of the inner maṇḍala starting in the Northeast and proceeding in pradakṣiṇa. And the thread is double the length of the maṇḍala; in thickness (<foreign>pārimaṇḍalya</foreign>) it is to be made as thick<note><seg rend="check">Or as long?</seg></note> as the (master's) little finger, in the case of a six-cubit (maṇḍala) and suitably (thicker) in other cases.<note><seg rend="check">See parallel passage in Rajaḥpātanavidhi.</seg></note>

The wise one should delineate a nice maṇḍala with a new thread, that is as well applied, as well measured and as beautiful as possible:\\

Having entered its inner city that resembles a wheel, circumscribed with a thread of vajra, and adorned with eight pillars, the wise one should delineate (the interior) maṇḍala, conveying it to symmetry, with eight maṇḍalas (within it, separated) by four threads (running in pairs from East to West and North to South).<note>Cf. the Trailokyavijayamaṇḍala shown in Mori 1997: 93, fig. 29.</note></p>

<p>And on both outer and inner platforms are to be drawn full and half pearl-garlands, fly-whisks as well as lunar and solar orbs.

In this connection, there are these seals and mantras.</p>

<p>Standing in archery stance, facing east, he should show a Vajra in the left (hand),<note>It seems that thus could mean either that the hand hold a physical Vajra, or that the hand is folded in Vajramuṣṭi.</note> hold the Vajra in the right (and) on the thigh and make the invitation with the hook (gesture) of the right index finger. Śakra's pledge seal is without the index hook. Standing in reverse archery stance, stretching out the index of the invitation seal: (this is) the dismissal seal. Now his mantra: \mantra{homage to the Vajra in every direction! o Vajra-holder, protect protect svāhā}.</p>

<p>He bends the index of his right hand in the shape of an earring, holds it against the third section of the needle which is his middle finger, and the thumb in the palm of his hand. (This is) the invitation seal for Agni. Starting from the invitation seal, the thumb placed on the side of the index: (this is) the pledge seal for Agni. Starting from this last seal, the nails of the thumb and the index are to be joined as one, facing each other in the palm of the hand:<note>Or, emending -madhyābhi-, translate: `facing the palm of them hand'.</note> (this is) the dismissal seal. The mantra: \mantra{o brownish agni, come here, blaze blaze, burn, fire, crested one, straight one, you with deformed eyes svāhā}.</p>

<p>The yogin, facing south, should hold his hands so that they face each other and he should hold his pair of thumbs inside the <seg rend="check">Abhyantaravajrabandha</seg> with the two ring-fingers held together outside like needle, and then folded back in: (this is) the invitation seal for Yama.

<p>Standing with face to the northwest,<note>The construction is a contamination of those seen at the beginnings of the two preceding paragraphs.</note> he should hold the index which was (previously) detached from the needle of the left middle (finger) to the third section (of the middle finger) in the shape of an earring, and he should stretch it out parallel (to the middle finger). Holding his right hand on the thigh, the invitation seal of Vāyu is (shown) with the bent thumb. The pledge seal of Vāyu is just like it, up to but not including the thumb. Having stretched out the thumb from the invitation seal: (this is) the dismissal seal. The mantra: \mantra{om̐ svasa khākha khakhaḥ svāhā}.</p>

<p>Standing with face to the north, he joins both hands. In the <seg rend="check">Abhyantaravajrabandha</seg> is the needle of the two pinky fingers.

<p>Standing with the face to the northeast, he should join together the two hands in an <foreign>añjali</foreign> and make a Vajra-bind of the palms (only) with the pinky and ring-fingers. He should (make) the pair of thumbs rest  on the middle fingers and fix the pair of index fingers outside of the needle (formed) by the middle fingers, in the form of a Vajra. Having bent the same (index fingers) at the top, he should make the fingernails touch each other: (this is) the invitation seal of Īśāna. From this same one, he should hold the index fingers, as previously, in the form of a Vajra: (this is) the pledge seal of Īśāna. From the invitation seal he should stretch the index fingers: (this is) the dismissal seal. The mantra: \mantra{om̐ jruṁ jruṁ svāhā}.</p>

<p>He should stand in reverse archery stance, fold the hands in in the form of <foreign>añjali</foreign> and gaze upward: the invitation of Brahmā, etc., is with the hook formed by the index fingers. From this same one, he should restore the index fingers to the previous position: (this is) the pledge seal. From the invitation seal he should stretch the index fingers: (this is) the dismissal seal. The mantras are: \mantra{to Brahmā above svāhā! to Sūrya the overlord of the <foreign>graha}s svāhā! to Candra the overlord of the lunar mansions svāhā!</foreign></p>

<p>He should stand in the equal-legged stance, should join his hands together, should loosely hold the finger tips to each other, (should hold) his thumbs in the form of circle, should gaze downward: the invitation of the earth, etc., is with the two index-finger hooks. He should hold the index fingers as previously: (this is) the pledge seal. From the invitation seal, the dismissal is with the stretched index fingers. The mantras: \mantra{to the earth below svāhā! to the Asuras svāhā! to the serpents svāhā!}.</p>

<p>Then he should give sipping water to all of them, with their respective mantras only, and dismiss all by saying: `Make freedom from obstacles for me, with my group of disciples, and give me success in my ritual!' </p>

If he does not take the vow, then he may enter (the maṇḍala) but no more.<note>This seems to mean that the pupil in question undergoes only Udakābhiṣeka, Makuṭapaṭṭābhiṣeka and Nāmābhiṣeka.

<p>The he should empower Vajrasattva, should worship him with perfumes, flowers, etc., put a garland on him and made his mouth fresh, should collect the best possible fee, consecrate (the pupil) with water from the jar standing outside (of the maṇḍala) and form the Sattvavajrī (seal) with this (mantra): \mantra{you are the pledge}.</p>

<p>Then he should let (the pupil) take a flower garland with his two middle fingers, and let him enter with this heart: \mantra{o pledge hūm̐}. And at the respective gates, with the (mantras called) Vajrāṅkuśa, etc.\ — namely \mantra{o vajrāṅkuśa jaḥ, o vajrapāśa hūm̐,  o vajrasphoṭa vam̐, o vajrāveśa hoḥ} — (he should perform the respective acts of attracting, causing to enter, binding and subjugating). <note>SDPT 290:

So I will generate for you the Vajra-Knowledge, through which knowledge you will also obtain the accomplishment of all Tathāgatas, not to mention other accomplishments. And by you it should not be divulged to one who has not seen the great maṇḍala. Your pledge should not waiver!'</p>

<p>Then the Vajra-master should display the Sattvavajrī-seal, both downward and upward, place it on the head of the Vajra-disciple, and say the following: `This pledge vajra will shatter your head, if you divulge it to anyone!'</p>

<p>Then he should, in the same manner with the Pledge-seal, once pronounce the imprecation-heart over the (pledge) water and give it to that disciple to drink. In that regard, there is is imprecation-heart:</p>
 
<p rend="stanza">
Vajrasattva himself is <seg rend="check">today/now</seg> present in your heart. If you divulge this system, he will immediately break out and leave. \mantra{om̐, vajra water ṭhaḥ}

</div>
<div type="subsection"><head type="editorial">Possession</head>
<p>Then he should visualize himself as white Vajrasattva <seg rend="check">as transformation from</seg> the syllable \mantra{a}. After that, he should visualize the syllable \mantra{a} in his own heart with a garland of Vajra-rays. Again, after letting the disciple visualize immaculate super pure Vajrasattva  <seg rend="check">as transformation from</seg> the syllable \mantra{hūm̐}, he should apply signs on his heart, brow, throat and forehead, with vajra, jewel, lotus and viśvavajra, as transformations of the syllables  \mantra{hūm̐ hrīm̐ hrīḥ kam̐}, and should  open his and his disciple's heart with the door-opening seal. Then he should emit the vajra situated in his own heart as transformation of the syllable \mantra{a}, mentally cause it to enter into the vajra situated in his disciple's heart, and visualize it as filling his entire body. He should say the following: `You should pronounce: ``And let all Tathāgatas take control, let Vajrasattva take posession of me!''.'
</p>
<p>Then the Vajra master quickly displays the Sattvavajrī, places it on the (disciple's) heart and should pronounce this:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
This pledge is that Vajra known as Vajrasattva. May the Vajra knowledge take possession of you right now.
\mantra{vajra possession aḥ}
</p>

<p>After it has been pronounced as many as ten times, or a hundred times, he certainly takes posssession (of the disciple). If possession does not occur, then by displaying the Wrath-fist he should cause the Sattvavajrī to burst. And he should pronounce \mantra{vajrasattva aḥ aḥ aḥ aḥ}, and visualize (the disciple) as being filled with by Lord Vajrasattva emitting red light. If possession does not occur even in that way, then he should display the Vajrāveśasamaya seal together with the bell. He should step with his left foot on (the disciple's) right foot, while, in the sky above, above Śrī Vajrasattva, he visualizes Vairocana being stepped upon by the mass of rays of the wrathful syllable \mantra{hūm̐}, 
	so that the aforementioned (Śrī Vajrasattva) takes possession (of the disciple),
<!--	% so that (the master) causes the aforementioned (Śrī Vajrasattva) to take possession (of the disciple),
	% so that he will enter the aforementioned (Śrī Vajrasattva),--> 
and (while visualizing) below (the disciple) being raised up by the Vajravātamaṇḍalī (seal) to the accompaniment of the syllable \mantra{hūm̐}, and while visualizing (Śrī Vajrasattva) as being hurled down by Akṣobhya, etc., who reside in the East, etc., with the mass of rays of their own seeds — namely \mantra{hūm̐ traḥ hrīḥ aḥ} —, he should cause him to take possession (of the disciple). He should repeat \mantra{vajrasattva aḥ aḥ aḥ aḥ} in this same manner.</p>

<p>Now (if) due to superabundance of sin possession does not occur, his sins need to be exploded again and again with the sin-explosion-seal.</p>

<p rend="stanza">
Immersed in his deity (<hi rend="italic">susamāhita</hi>), he should ignite the fire with fuel of Madhura (wood) and burn down all his sins with a sesame oblation. \mantra{om̐ to the vajra which burns all sins svāhā!}
</p>

<p>(This is the mantra he should use) after he has made an effigy of the sin with black sesame seeds in the palm of his right hand, has visualized the syllable \mantra{hūm̐} in the middle, in order to make the oblation with this index and thumb.
</p>
<p>Then (if) he leaves the oblation pit and visualizes in the (disciple's) body the sin being burnt by vajras full of flame garlands, (the deity) definitely takes possession. For one whose possession does not occur even in that way,  he should not carry out <seg rend="check">consecration</seg>.</p>

<p>And for one who is possessed, the ripening of the Five Magical powers, etc., then immediately occurs.</p>

<p>Then, once he has determined (the disciple) to be possessed, the master should display the pledge-seal of Vajrasattva<note><seg rend="check">Vajrasattvasamayamudrā: what is this?</seg></note> with the words \mantra{he vajrasatta! he vajraratna! he vajdradharma! he vajrakarma!} and pronounce again \mantra{dance sattva dance vajra!}. If the (disciple), being possessed, displays the seal of Śrī Vajrasattva, then the master shows the seal of the Vajra-fist. In this way, all starting with Śrī Vajrasattva arrange their presence. Then (the master) should enquire regarding a desired object, visualize a Vajra on the tongue of this possessed (disciple), and speak with this (procedure):<note>See MSK §83 anena vidhinā vaktavyam.</note> \mantra{tell, o Vajra!} Then (the disciples) tells everything.

<p>Then comes the esoteric consecration. He should have a disciple who is eligible for consecration to become master enter [into the maṇḍala] and teach him the real meaning of all of the maṇḍala and the deities,<note>See Bhramahara and Abhisamayamañjarī for occurrences of maṇḍalatattva and devatātattva. RT mentions article by Alex Wayman.</note> as well as the office of a master. Only so far extends the esoteric consecration through which he is consecrated.<note><seg rend="check">RT In later times this cons. is called ācāryābhiṣeka whereas guhyābhi. would certainly involve erotic elements. It is likely that Ānandagarbha knew of the existence of such practices. So it sounds like the intended meaning is in opposition thereto: `That is enough by way of esoteric consecration to consecrate him.'</seg></note></p>

<p>Thus the abbreviated procedure.</p>

<div type="section" n="2"><head type="editorial">Intermediate procedure</head>

<p>Now is discussed the intermediate procedure.

</p>
<p>Then he should worship that altar with flowers, etc. Either on a lion-throne covered with a cloth (on which is depicted) a lunar disc, or on a (regular) seat that has been empowered with the Vajrayakṣa (mantra), he should as previously and transform him into Vajrasattva and install him there with the Great Seal of Vajrasattva.<note><seg rend="check">

<p>Then comes the extensive procedure for consecration. In the same way he should perform everything and should worship (the disciple) with the eightfold worship by means of dance, etc. Then he should take a jewel(-studded) stick or a golden stick, stand in front (of the disciple) and  pronounce the following with clear voice:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
O child, the veil of your ignorance has been removed by the Jinas, just as chief surgeons with sticks (remove) the people's cataract.<note>Tanemura 2004: 180, 280 translated `scalpel' in his book.</note></p>

<p>Now the heart for it: \mantra{om̐ vajra-eye remove the veil hrīḥ}. Then he should take a mirror and recount the charactistic<seg rend="check">s</seg> of the entities.</p>

<p rend="stanza">
The entities are like reflections, transparent, clear, stainless, imperceptible, inexpressable, and they arise from actions as cause.\\
Recognizing entities to be like that — devoid of own nature, baseess — you should act for universal, incomparable benefit. You are a legitimate son of the Saviors!
</p>

<p>Then he takes the bell and, while sounding it (he should pronounce):</p>

<p rend="stanza">
Everying is of ethereal aspect, and ether itself has no aspect. The ultimate sameness of everything is clear as a consequence of the sameness with ether.
</p>

<p>And then he should give the bell. <seg rend="check">The heart mantra for the giving of the bell will be \mantra{aḥ}.</seg></p>

<p>While (reciting) \mantra{show affection to all Tathāgatas} he should launch four arrows in the four directions. Some, however, say that <seg rend="check">a cover is to be made</seg> below and above with \mantra{hoḥ}.</p>

<p>He should again take the mirror and say the following:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
For you, Vajrasattva is like a mirror: transparent, clear and stainless. The overlord of all Buddhas is himself present in the heart, o child.
</p>

<p>He should also say: `Understand that this overlord of all Tathāgatas is this aspiration to awakening'.<note>It seems that Ānandagarbha has forgotten the concluding <foreign>iti</foreign> that is required after <foreign>avagaccha</foreign>.</note> Now the mantra for his receiving of the mirror: \mantra{ā vajrasattva}.</p>

<p>Then he should place a wheel of the Law between (the disciple's) feet, give a conch (to be held) in his right hand, and say the following:</p>

<p rend="stanza">
From <seg rend="check">today/now</seg> onward, having filled the unsurpassed conch of the Law, turn the wheel of the Law in all direction immediately at the mere conception of the aspiration.\\
With unhesitating mind, you have no doubt or uncertainty. Give permanent light in the world to the precept which is the system of mantra practice.\\
You are praised as being a grateful servant of the Buddhas. And those Vajra-bearers all protect all around you.
