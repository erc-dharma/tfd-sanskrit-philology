`Naimittikakarmānusandhānam' Asiatic Society of Bengal, MS G 4767.  ``83 (+1) folios. Missing 1--3, 5, 7--8, 13--14, 19--21, 23, 25, 58, 77, 79--80, 91, 94--95. Brittle, often illegible.'' (Card preceding microfilm). Palm-leaves (29 cm. in length) with 5 lines on each side and about 48 akṣaras in each line. The script is Nepalese. The date of copying is not recorded; but the script is very similar to that of the Picumata ms. of \ad 1052 (NAK 3-370). Folio numbers in arabic numerals have been added in pencil on each side, with a and b for recto and verso. Composed by Brahmaśambhu of the Karkaroṇī branch of the Mattamayūra lineage of the Siddhānta in Śaka 860 (\ad 938). It is based on the \textit{Dviśata} (i.e. the \textit{Dviśatika-Kālottara}) (\textit{ukto mayaiṣa dviśatārthasaṃgī dīkṣāvi}(103v1)\textit{dhir}). We have here an incomplete text of the \textit{Naimittikakriyānusandhāna}. It refers back to a \textit{Nity[akriy]ānusandhāna} (\textit{tac ca nityānusaṃdhāne pūrvvaṃ yena mayoditam / teneha na punar vācyaṃ naimittika}(27a5)\textit{kriyākrame}), which is evidently the first part of the work of which this is the second. The author dates it where our manuscript ends. The folio numeration shows that the manuscript contained only the Naimittika section of his Paddhati. The final folio is numbered 103 and there are approximately 15 verses on each folio. The total length of the work was therefore approximately 1500 verses. This is a more detailed work than Somaśambhu's, which covers much more in about 1800 verses. There is no indication of a section on Kāmya rites in what we have of this manuscript. But Vaktraśambhu refers to a \textit{kāmyapaddhatiḥ} by Brahmaśambhu in his commentary on the \textit{Mṛgendrapaddhati} (cod. cit.,  p.178: \textit{brahmaśambhur iti kāmyapaddhatyām}).


The Naimittikānusaṃdhāna comprises five Paricchedas:


(1) gurukulaniḥkramaṇapūrvakaparicchedaḥ: 360 verses
(2) śivāgniśiṣyādhivāsaparicchedaḥ: 282 verses
(3) nirvāṇadīkṣāparicchedaḥ: 273 verses
(4) [ācāryasādhakarājābhiṣekaparicchedaḥ]: total uncertain
(5) [antyeṣṭiśrāddhaparicchedaḥ]: total uncertain


The work is the earliest of the Śaiva Paddhatis to have survived, and perhaps the first to have been written, since it is probable that the Paddhatis attributed to Ugrajyotis and Sadyojyotis existed in name alone. It is certainly the earliest of those quoted by later authorities. The work survives, it appears, only in this badly preserved (and badly microfilmed) Nepalese manuscript. But it was certainly influential on the practice of Saiddhāntika ritual throughout the subcontinent. It is cited as a fundamental authority by later authors at opposite ends of the region, by Rājānaka Takṣavarta of Kashmir in his Nityādisaṃgrahapaddhati and by all the main writers of and commentators on Paddhatis in the Far South, both in Coladeśa (by Jñānaśiva, Aghoraśiva, Trilocanaśiva, Vaktraśambhu, Nirmalamaṇi, Kacchapeśvara and the compiler of the Ātmārthapūjāpaddhati) and Kerala (by Īśānaśivagurudeva).  Trilocanaśiva tells us in his commentary on the Paddhati of Somaśambhu that he had written a commentary on it (p. 21: \textit{brahmaśambhupaddhatau …… nimittañ cāsmābhir vistareṇa taṭṭīkāyāṃ nirūpitam; brahmaśambhupaddhatau …… etadarthanirūpaṇam asmābhir vistareṇa taṭṭīkāyām
uktatvān neha prapañcyate}), referring also to Brahmaśambhu's \textit{Pañcikā} on the \textit{Dviśatika} (p. 140: \textit{dviśatipañcikāyāṃ brahmaśambhupaddhatau ca draṣṭavyam}). Aghoraśiva acknowledges that it was one his fundamental guides in the composition of his own influental Paddhati \textit{Kriyākramadyotikā}. The whole tradition of the Saiddhāntika Paddhatikāras would seem to derive from Brahmaśambhu in the tenth century and Bhojarāja in the eleventh (r. 1018 to 1060).

<!-- Perhaps what is intended here is that the body of the yajamāna is equated, as it were, with the Vāstupuruṣa, in order to identify in which areas of the Vāstu there are faults or extraneous materials in the earth. This would follow from the following passages:

The 24th chapter of the Pratiṣṭhalakṣaṇasārasamuccaya describes the rites for the removal of extraneous materials (śālyoddhāram). It appears that certain bodily signs and pains of the future house owner, the yajamāna, - such as extraneous materials in the body - are taken to indicate the location of fault or extraneous material on the site.

Also Īśānagurudevapaddhati 3.26.90ff seems to feature a procedure in which the yajamāna seems to be joined with the measuring thread, which when straight indicates that there are no extraneous materials in the earth, and when bent because the yajamāna scratches himself etc. indicates fault. An added prose passage then spells out which bodily movements and other omens such as animals crossing the threat correspond to certain faults in the earth or within the structure. At the end of this prose passage it is indicated that the Brahmaśambhu teaches the sam.
